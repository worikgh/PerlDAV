      $WebDAV::USERS_FN	Describes user accounts
      $WebDAV::LOCK_FN 	Holds lock descriptions

WebDAV.pm provides all the services for running a Web DAV server

add_webDAV_user creates an account for a user.

      Takes as arguments a user name, password, root collection and
      quota (storage area size) for a new user.  If any of these do
      not exist it prompts on stdin/stdout for them

      It checks that the user does not exist and that the root
      collection does not exist as a resource.  (It is OK for two users
      to share a route collection)

      The file that stores passwords is in WebDAV ($PASSWORD_FN
      accessesed by WebDAV::get_PASSWORD_FN())

      The route collection is created with...

            WebDAV::_createCollection( WebDAV::get_ROOT()."/$root")

       $root is passed in root collection

       WebDAV::_addUsers does the heavy lifting from then...

       The file $USERS_FN stores user names, and root collections.
